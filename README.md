# JAMStack personal blog starter files - Full Stack March Madness 2022 

This is the first project that I have completed for the MEANStack Developer Newsletter's Full Stack March Madness 2022, where various tech stacks are compared against eachother to determine a champion of the Full Stacks! I thought it would be a fun way for me to learn more about each tech stack and teach my readers more.

This project was really fun and ended up splitting into a few ways. This project site has ended up being the starter for my MT Man Adventures business and you can view it here: https://mtman.ventures which is a General Store and Blog. That will be migrated and this will be turrned to the Jamstack March Madness project.

I also am going to build a starter template from this prjoct for 11ty. It is always cool to have the starter files that make it easy for anyone to jump on and create a website quickly. 

##There is more to come from this project

I am busy trying to find work and such that I don't have a lot of time to spend cleaning up the file with documentation and tutorials yet, but I will slowly update those as much as I can. For now, I hope you can enjoy the beautiful simplicity of this website!
