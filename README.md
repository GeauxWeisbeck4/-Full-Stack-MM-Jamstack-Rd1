# mtman.ventures Jamstack Blog (eCommerce and more coming)

I went through the same Jamstack project I did the first time to make: https://mtman.ventures which is a General Store and Blog. 

I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to use the blog for and then the idea kind of came out of nowhere. I'm planning out a small eCommerce adventure and another fun blog to keep up. 

Stay Tuned
